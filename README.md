# 💬 Chat Messenger with Log Facility

## 🛠️ Technology
- Java Programming

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based peer-to-peer chat application** that enables real-time text communication between users. It uses **Java Socket Programming** to establish direct connections and maintains a **log file** that records all conversations periodically for future reference.

The application is **platform and architecture independent**, meaning it can run on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
